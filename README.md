# Modeling & Forecasting Canadian National Bankruptcy Rates
## Problem description :
Understanding how national bankruptcy rates change over time is important for risk management and it has always been of interest to national banks, insurance companies, credit-lenders, and politicians etc. The goal of this report is to precisely and accurately forecast monthly bankruptcy rates for Canada.

In this report, we will exploit the monthly statistics of Canadian bankruptcy rate, unemployment rate, population as well as house price index, for the period of January 1987 to December 2014, and construct a model for bankruptcy rates. We will use the constructed model to predict the monthly data for bankruptcy rates from January 2015 to  December 2017.
